# Activities

not necessary to do all !!! (as Sami said on 13.03.2023) made task 4 at least!

## Task 1

- Refer to te following link. Explain the Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm.
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-visual-introduction/

## Task 2

- Explain how the code in `./src/dspa.cpp` works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-program-for-dijkstras-shortest-path-algorithm-greedy-algo-7/

## Task 3

- Explain how the code in `./src/mspt.cpp` works. Refer to the following link:
  https://www.tutorialspoint.com/kruskal-s-minimum-spanning-tree-algorithm-greedy-algorithm-in-cplusplus#

## Task 4: Individual (at home)

- Refer to te following link. Explain when to use the greedy methods and when to avoid them.
  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/when-to-use-greedy-algorithms/
  the answer:
  when to use the greedy methods: examples:
  The vertex cover of a graph is the minimum set of vertices such that every edge of the graph has at least one of its endpoints in the set.
  This is a very hard problem. Actually, there isn't any efficient and exact solution for it. But the good news is that we can make a good approximation with a greedy algorithm.

  when to avoid the greedy methods: for example, Dijkstra's algorithm doesn't work in graphs with negative edges. Also Traveling salesman problem.
